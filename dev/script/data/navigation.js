    detailedDescription: "I've created UI Designs since the start of my career working on CD-ROMs and Flash sites.  I then moved on to Web Design which initially was straight forward until the levels of complexity with Responsive Design moved in.  I now love the challenges that Responsive Design brings and feel some generic template boundaries needs pushing especially in transitioning between content which is a whole new ball game. All of the following pieces are Website, CD-ROM and Flash designs and mostly fairly bespoke.",

    detailedDescription: "From Branding, Illustration and Icons I've worked on a lot of graphics. From winning a pitch to make an e-card with Puma in my early days to knocking out logos in a morning and accepted by the client during lunch.  UI and Branding always does better with that little extra Oooomph otherwise it's just colored in wireframes right..? With a huge photo or video filling the screen on the home page right?",

    detailedDescription: "What's this? A front end design / developer who can draw? And not just with vectors making simple blocked shapes? Yes, I do like drawing, mostly black and white with a little red thrown in as you will see from the gallery.  I do have a penchant for zombies I won't lie to you.",
